# A TTL Simulator)

This is a logic emulator.  The purpose of this project is to simulate digital logic circuits from a stand-point of timing.  
Each logic gate can be setup to represent different types of TTL logic timings.  Then a circuit can be wired up and executed 
to see what the timing output would be.

It is the hope of this project to prepare the mind for the eventuality of creating unique, self-learning machines (see Ideal) running on minimalist hardware.
